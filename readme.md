# Switcheo Code Challenge #

This is my submission for Switcheo's Full-Stack Software Engineer Internship Code Challenge

There are 5 problems in this challenge, each testing different skillsets that are required for a Blockchain Software Engineer

## Thoughts ##

I really enjoyed completing all the tasks provided! <br />
The tasks were of moderate difficulty, and they provide good exposure to the different technicalities of Blockchain development (Ethereum Development, Front-end Development, Database Architecture, Smart Contract Development etc.) <br />
Considering how niche Blockchain Development is, there are very little practice resources out there for developing one's expertise in this area. <br />
These tasks would definitely be suitable for developers trying to get into the Blockchain Development space. <br />

What I enjoyed most about the problems was that although each question has a clearly outlined desired output, but the solution and tools utilized to get to the output are not restrictive. I was glad I was allowed to developed the solutions using environments and tools that I am comfortable with. <br />

## Takeaways ##

1. Learnt how to convert Javascript to Typescript from Problem 4
2. Refreshed my memory of basic SQL syntaxes for Problem 7
3. Explored Framer Motion to implement animations for Problem 2
4. Learnt how to work with Git (forking, cloning) *(still need to work on this)*

## Conclusion ##

This was a fun challenge and I am excited to share my solutions with you guys!
